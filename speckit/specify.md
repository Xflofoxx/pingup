OpenCode Spec Kit – Specify

User story:
- As an OpenCode developer, I want to define a clear specification for the agent so that downstream tasks are unambiguous and testable.

Scope:
- This phase captures the intent, goals, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

Stakeholders:
- OpenCode Team, AI Agent

Constraints:
- The specification should be concise, avoid deep technical implementation details, and be testable.
- The document must be Markdown-valid and linear.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The spec includes user story, success criteria, non-functional requirements, constraints.
- Sufficient detail to drive planning and task creation.

Non-goals:
- Do not include concrete code here.

- References to SPEC.md and AGENTS.md
