OpenCode Spec Kit for OpenCode

Overview: This repository includes a Spec Kit tailored for OpenCode. It follows the Spec Kit four-phase workflow: specify, plan, tasks, implement. The spec artifacts serve as the source of truth and drive the engineering work.

Files:
- speckit/specify.md: high-level description, acceptance criteria, constraints
- speckit/plan.md: architecture decisions, non-functional requirements, risk
- speckit/tasks.md: breakdown into actionable tasks
- speckit/implement.md: coding guidelines and expected outputs

Usage:
- Fill specify.md with user stories and success criteria
- Populate plan.md with technical architecture and choices
- Break down into tasks.md
- Implement code guided by implement.md

Notes: This skeleton is designed to be lightweight and “executable” in spirit; it should be revised as the project evolves.
