OpenCode Agent Specification (OpenCode)

This document describes how the repo aligns with the OpenCode Spec Kit methodology.

Spec Kit alignment
- speckit/ directory contains specify.md, plan.md, tasks.md, implement.md
- SPEC.md remains the source of truth for high-level requirements
- AGENTS.md now includes notes on operating with Spec Kit flows

Core workflow
- specify -> plan -> tasks -> implement
- Artifacts produced in each phase feed the next

Usage notes
- The project should maintain the Speckit artifacts at speckit/*
- The SPEC.md should reference speckit artifacts where appropriate
